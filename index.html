        <h3>Etymology</h3>
        <p>
          "Boiler plate" originally referred to the maker's label used to
          identify the builder of steam boilers.[1]
        </p>
        <p>
          In the field of printing, the term dates back to the early 1900s. From
          the 1890s onwards, printing plates of text for widespread reproduction
          such as advertisements or syndicated columns were cast or stamped in
          steel (instead of the much softer and less durable lead alloys used
          otherwise) ready for the printing press and distributed to newspapers
          around the United States. By analogy, they came to be known as
          'boilerplates'. One large supplier to newspapers of this kind of
          boilerplate was the Western Newspaper Union, which supplied
          "ready-to-print stories [which] contained national or international
          news" to papers with smaller geographic footprints, which could
          include advertisements pre-printed next to the conventional
          content.[2]
        </p>
        <p class="visually-hidden">
          Some companies also sent out press releases as boilerplate so that
          they had to be printed as written. The modern equivalent is the press
          release boilerplate, or "boiler," a paragraph or two that describes
          the company and its products.

        <h3>Boilerplate Language</h3>
        <p>
          In contractual law, the term "boilerplate language" describes the
          parts of a contract that are considered standard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Boilerplate language may also exist in pre-created form letters on the
          Internet for such things as issues to be broached by a politician
          based on an issue ad, requests that a cable or satellite operator add
          a cable network to a system, pre-written complaints about a product
          that is opposed by groups that create such letters, or online
          petitions. The person requesting the action usually only needs to type
          or sign his or her name at the end of the pre-written greeting and
          body.

        <h3>Boilerplate Code</h3>
        <p>
          In computer programming, boilerplate is the sections of code that have
          to be included in many places with little or no alteration. Such
          boilerplate is particularly salient when the programmer must include a
          lot of code for minimal functionality. The need for boilerplate can be
          reduced through high-level mechanisms.
        </p>
        <p>
          A related phenomenon, bookkeeping code, is code that is not part of
          the business logic but is interleaved with it in order to keep data
          structures updated or able to handle secondary aspects of the program.
